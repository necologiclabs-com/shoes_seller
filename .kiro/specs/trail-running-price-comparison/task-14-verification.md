### Code Quality

- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors (`npm run build`)
- [x] CDK synth succeeds (`npm run synth`)
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] Proper imports added (s3, cloudfront, origins)

### Configuration

- [x] Public access blocked
- [x] Retention policy set to RETAIN
- [x] Price class optimized (PRICE_CLASS_100)
- [x] Cache policy optimized (CACHING_OPTIMIZED)

## ✅ Sub-task 14.2: ビルドとデプロイスクリプトの作成

### Deployment Scripts Created

- [x] `scripts/deploy-frontend.ps1` (Windows PowerShell)
- [x] `scripts/deploy-frontend.sh` (Linux/Mac Bash)
- [x] `scripts/configure-frontend.ps1` (Windows PowerShell)
- [x] `scripts/configure-frontend.sh` (Linux/Mac Bash)

### Script Features

- [x] Fetches stack outputs from CloudFormation
- [x] Auto-configures frontend with API URL
- [x] Builds frontend (`npm run build`)
- [x] Uploads to S3 with proper cache headers
- [x] Creates CloudFront invalidation
- [x] Waits for invalidation completion
- [x] Error handling and validation
- [x] User-friendly output with emojis

### NPM Scripts Added

- [x] `deploy:frontend` - Deploy frontend only
- [x] `deploy:all` - Deploy backend + frontend
- [x] `build:frontend` - Build frontend only
- [x] `configure:frontend` - Configure environment variables

### Documentation Created

- [x] `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
- [x] `scripts/README.md` - Scripts documentation
- [x] `frontend/.env.production.example` - Environment template
- [x] Updated main `README.md` with deployment info

### Cache Strategy

- [x] Static assets: `max-age=31536000, immutable`
- [x] index.html: `max-age=0, must-revalidate`
- [x] CloudFront invalidation for `/*`

### Environment Configuration

- [x] Frontend uses `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable
- [x] Scripts auto-generate `.env.production` from stack outputs
- [x] Example environment file provided

## Requirements Verification

### Requirement 7.1: AWS基盤のバックエンドアーキテクチャ

- [x] Uses AWS services (S3, CloudFront)
- [x] Scalable infrastructure
- [x] Proper AWS resource configuration

### Requirement 7.5: セキュアな通信

- [x] HTTPS enforced (redirect-to-https)
- [x] Origin Access Identity for secure S3 access
- [x] Public access blocked on S3 bucket
- [x] Encryption enabled

### Requirement 8.5: ビルドとデプロイ

- [x] Production build script
- [x] S3 deployment script
- [x] CloudFront cache invalidation
- [x] Automated deployment workflow

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-deployment Tests

- [x] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [x] CDK synth generates valid CloudFormation
- [x] No syntax errors in scripts
- [x] Package.json scripts are valid

### Post-deployment Tests (To be done after actual deployment)

- [ ] Backend stack deploys successfully
- [ ] S3 bucket is created
- [ ] CloudFront distribution is created
- [ ] Frontend deployment script runs successfully
- [ ] Files are uploaded to S3
- [ ] CloudFront serves the frontend
- [ ] API calls work from frontend
- [ ] Cache headers are correct
- [ ] SPA routing works (no 404 on refresh)
- [ ] HTTPS redirect works

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

1. `scripts/deploy-frontend.ps1`
2. `scripts/deploy-frontend.sh`
3. `scripts/configure-frontend.ps1`
4. `scripts/configure-frontend.sh`
5. `scripts/README.md`
6. `DEPLOYMENT.md`
7. `frontend/.env.production.example`
8. `.kiro/specs/trail-running-price-comparison/task-14-summary.md`
9. `.kiro/specs/trail-running-price-comparison/task-14-verification.md`

### Modified Files

1. `lib/price-comparison-stack.ts` - Added S3 and CloudFront resources
2. `package.json` - Added deployment scripts
3. `README.md` - Updated with deployment information

## Success Criteria

All criteria met:

- ✅ S3 bucket configured for static hosting
- ✅ CloudFront distribution configured
- ✅ Deployment scripts created for both Windows and Unix
- ✅ Cache invalidation implemented
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ NPM scripts added
- ✅ Environment configuration automated
- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ Requirements satisfied

## Notes

- Scripts support both Windows (PowerShell) and Unix (Bash)
- Environment variables are automatically configured from stack outputs
- CloudFront invalidation can take 5-15 minutes
- S3 bucket has RETAIN policy (won't be deleted with stack)
- Cache strategy optimized for SPA with content-hashed assets
